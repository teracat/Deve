# - ACR_PASSWORD: The password or access key for the ACR.
#
# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) access:
# - AZURE_CREDENTIALS: A JSON string containing Azure service principal credentials, generated using `az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth`.
# - AKS_CLUSTER_NAME: The name of the AKS cluster to deploy to.
# - AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP: The name of the Azure resource group containing the AKS cluster.
#
# Email notification settings:
# - SMTP_SERVER: The address of the SMTP server used to send emails.
# - SMTP_PORT: The port used by the SMTP server (e.g., 587).
# - EMAIL_USERNAME: The username of the email account used to send notifications.
# - EMAIL_PASSWORD: The password or app-specific password for the email account.
